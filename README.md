# Mega Blog React Website
This is blog website in which I have used `React` and `Redux Toolkit` with `localstorage` (to add todos in storage so that todos do not vanish after refresh page).
In this website, a user can create their account and start uploading thier blog post.

## Backend Service

In this project, I had used appwrite backend service for `database`, `storage` and for `authorization` also.
